                    <h4 class="h4--description">The unprecedented growth of social media, in conjunction with negligent internal design decisions, have enkindled widespread social media addiction within adolescents and young adults.
                        <br><br>Sol is an app that redesigns the way users interact with their social media, by intervening within the addictive Hook Model and thereby encouraging more mindful screen time. 
                        <br><br>Sol was developed by our team using the double diamond design framework, which included comprehensive research, exhaustive idea generation and an iterative design process.

                During the re-brand from <i>"Nudgeless"</i> to our final design <i>"Sol"</i>, we discovered how many of our pre-conceptions as designers evolved in light of new data, opinions and suggestions derived from user feedback. This experience re-inforced the importance of design processes in delivering a solution that is effective to a targeted design problem.
