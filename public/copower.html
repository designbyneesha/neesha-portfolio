            <h4 class="h4--description">
                The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the multiple failures of capitalism by amplifying preexisting systemic inequalities.
                While allowing some people to thrive from remote work, those of low income, racialised, gendered, and disabled 
                backgrounds are unable to access the technology and housing necessary to make telework feasible.

                We aimed to examine this within the

                low wage growth and the housing crisis, placing them at the crux of systemic equity in the
                workplace (Wood & Griffiths, 2019).

            <h5 class="h5--description heading">WHY CONTEXT MAPPING?</h5>
            <h4 class="h4--description">
                Studying the primary context of product use can challenge the biases of the designer and foster user empathy, 
                resulting in a human-centred and innovative product (Visser, Stappers, Lugt, & Sanders, 2007).
                <br><br>This involves
                democratising the design process through generative and participatory techniques, seeking to
                design with users to understand their current and future concerns.

            <h5 class="h5--description heading">WHY SENSITISING ACTIVITIES?</h5>
            <h4 class="h4--description">
                The sensitising process seeks to prepare users for the group session to ensure the extraction of
                rich qualitative and quantitative information (Visser, Stappers, Lugt, & Sanders, 2007). 
                <br><br>This involves exercises aiming to elicit inspirational reflections on past, present, and future experiences
                of working from home compared to the office (Tomitsch et al., 2021).

                programs as they would in the office. Their changes are automatically synced up for the next time they go into the office.

            <h4 class="h4--description">
                Firstly, our solution <span style="color:#F6AE2D">addresses financial barriers</span> by providing communal material resources for those systemically disadvantaged. 
                <br><br>Secondly, by providing disturbance-free space and technology for productive work, we have <span style="color:#F6AE2D">compensated for the housing and digital barriers. </span>
                <br><br>Finally, drawing upon Maslow's Theory of Motivation, the fulfilment of people's material needs can allow them to address the psychological 
                impact of a lack of work-life boundaries, thereby <span style="color:#F6AE2D">cultivating an equitable workplace. </span>
            </h4>
            <h5 class="h5--description heading">FINAL WORDS</h5>
            <h4 class="h4--description">To conclude, while some have been able to flourish during the transition to telework, 
                marginalised groups have been neglected due to structural barriers, which leads to a blurring of work-life boundaries. 
                Copower Collective addresses this through a coworking platform, thereby reinforcing an equitable, post-pandemic workplace.
