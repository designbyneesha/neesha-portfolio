                        <br><br>After crafting a development pitch, I spent several weeks implementing a functional prototype using HTML, Sass, and Node.js runtime environment.</h4>

            <h5 class="h5--description">PROJECT OBJECTIVE</h5>
            <h4 class="h4--description">The overall assessment required me to design and prototype a web application to help students manage their study sessions. My initial task involved researching and identifying which subgroup of this demographic I thought could benefit the most from such a tool. 
                <br><br>I would then need to conduct the necessary research concerning my target audience, and construct a proposal pitch consisting of relevant user personas and service mockups.

            <h5 class="h5--description">FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS</h5>
            <h4 class="h4--description">The functional requirements for the design brief were dictated by a competitive analysis of existing study services, which identified task, time, and content management tools as key ingredients. Thus, the feature requirements were split into three main components:

            <h4 class="h4--description">Having prior interest and experience within the realm of computer science, I selected programming and software engineering students as my target audience for the study platform. 
                <br><br>As a former Computer Science student at the University of Berkeley, California, I was aware of the courseload's rigor, and hypothesized that a tailored digital service could dramatically improve study habits and course marks for overwhelmed students.

            <h5 class="h5--description" style="margin-top:3em;">USER PERSONAS</h5>
            <h4 class="h4--description">I conducted relevant secondary research and performed an online ethnography involving student learning patterns, coding productivity tools, and user frustrations. 
                From there, I constructed several personas to identify current user goals, motivations, and frustrations.

            <h4 class="h4--description">I decided to separate the website content into three work sections (“Plan”, “Focus”, “Learn”), to allow for mental compartmentalisation of study structure.
                <br><br>I added categories to the Kanban board for task grouping between classes, and also added a "Today's Focus" section to encourage pointedness and pre-study task planning, while avoiding overexertion.

            <h5 style="margin-top:3em;" class="h5--description">VISUAL & COLOR EXPLORATION</h5>
            <h4 class="h4--description">I used the color palette from the Atlassian Design System to ensure visual accessibility and researched color psychology.
                <br><br>I also chose to re-use familiar component styles and visuals from popular coding services that students mentioned in my online ethnography (e.g. GitHub, VSCode, LeetCode). 
                Since the majority of students would either be learning or working on these platforms, utilising a similar visual style would allow students to feel more comfortable in the Spiral.io environment, 
                as well as mentally compartmentalise their work.
                <br><br>Based on my research, I also decided on a dark palette to reduce eye strain for nocturnal developers, and an off-black base to avoid high contrast.
